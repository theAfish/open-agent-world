# Runs and runtime providers

Open Agent World keeps four execution concepts separate:

- **Agent** is the persistent actor and capability-bearing world object.
- **Task** is a future work contract. A Task may have several Run attempts.
- **Run** is one durable execution attempt by one Agent.
- **External Job** is a future long-running operation started during a Run.

The persisted `RunRecord` is authoritative. Provider events are live output,
not lifecycle storage. A provider turn ending also does not imply that the Run
succeeded: a provider must explicitly emit a terminal `run_status`. If its
event stream ends without one, `RunManager` leaves the Run in `waiting`.

## Lifecycle

Valid transitions are centralized in `RunManager`:

```text
created -> running
created -> cancelled
running -> waiting | succeeded | failed | cancelled
waiting -> running | succeeded | failed | cancelled
```

`succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `interrupted` are terminal. On backend
startup, persisted `created`, `running`, or `waiting` records from the prior
process are marked `interrupted`; they are never silently reported as success.

Agent card status remains operational. A failed Run returns the Agent to
`idle`; it does not set the Agent to `error`. A waiting Run also releases the
Agent's operational busy state. `max_concurrent_runs` is an explicit per-Agent
configuration policy (default `1`) and counts executing `running` Runs, not
durable waiting Runs.

## Lineage and cancellation

A root Run points `root_run_id` to itself. A child stores its immediate
`parent_run_id` and inherits the root, task, and context correlation when those
values are not overridden. Invocation code running inside a provider receives
an immutable `InvocationContext`, so later delegate/spawn/controller features
can create descendants without passing application services or provider SDK
objects through the boundary.

Cancellation addresses a `run_id`. By default, cancelling a parent recursively
cancels every non-terminal descendant. A nested caller can explicitly start a
detached root Run when that propagation is not desired. `POST /api/agents/{agent_id}/stop`
remains a convenience that cancels all non-terminal Runs for that Agent.

## Runtime providers

Providers are registered on `PluginRegistry` under namespaced IDs such as
`google.adk` and `core.mock`. `RunManager` resolves the Agent card's optional
`runtime_provider_id`, falling back to the configured application default.
Provider instances are cached per provider ID, not globally assumed to be the
only runtime in a world. Provider SDK sessions, runners, and events remain
inside their provider implementation.

Run inspection and cancellation are available at:

```text
GET  /api/runs
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}
GET  /api/runs/{run_id}/children
POST /api/runs/{run_id}/cancel
```
